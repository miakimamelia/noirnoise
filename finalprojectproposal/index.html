            <h2>Context</h2>
            <br>
        <p>
            //sense is an experimental time-based artist collective that features new media, technologies, performance, video, sound, installation, and beyond. To celebrate the media practices at SAIC, we are organizing a whole day of events at the MacLean Ballroom on 12/16 showcasing new media/sound/video installation and audiovisual performances. Me and a few other peers are organizing an Electronic Cafe for Internet Art, which will become a group installation at this event. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why Make This Project?</h2><br>
        
        <p>This website will be my first web based artwork that will be part of a public exhibition. Exhibitions are multilayered opportunities to experience, present my work, and connect (network) with other peers/artists/mentors that share interests in this field. I want to make this project because it will:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Push me to work with specific deadlines</li>
            <li>Push me to practice a proper and orderly process of website building</li>
            <li>Becomes a work in my portfolio</li>
            <li>Becomes experience on my resume</li>

        </ul><br>

        <h2>Challenges</h2><br>
        <p>Some Challenges I will encounter:</p><br>

          <ul>
            <li>The website is the red thread of all the content, so I anticipate some difficulty trying to design a cohesive aesthetic that ties everything together, especially if not all the content is made yet.</li>
            <li>For most of the techinical things I don't know, I usually figure out by researching online. If I can't find the answer to a specific issue, I will definitely reach out in class or in the coding club discord!</li>
            <li> Keeping myself accountable for what gets done every week will be the main challenge, especially since researching and watching tutorials can be very time consuming. </li>
          </ul>
           
    </p><br>
