    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            //sense is an experimental time-based artist collective that features new media, technologies, performance, video, sound, installation, and beyond. To celebrate the media practices at SAIC, we are organizing a whole day of events at the MacLean Ballroom on 12/16 showcasing new media/sound/video installation and audiovisual performances. Me and a few other peers are organizing an Electronic Cafe for Internet Art, which will become a group installation at this event. 
        </p>

        <h3>Considerations/Questions/Inspiration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Does the internet feel like an entrance or an enclosure?</li>
            <li>Mystical places on the internet</li>
            <li>Web-address as password to enter spaces on the internet</li>
            <li>"Plants communicate through a system of fungal networks (which bear some structural resemblance to our physical internet).</li>
            <li>Artificial/Digital environments</li>
            <li>Biomimicry</li>
            <li>User Interfaces (and Subverting them)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <p>
            For this class's final project, I will be creating a website that is the landing page and home for variuous works of interactive web art: 3D virtual spaces, virtual art gallery, art games, etc.

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Why Make This Project?</h2>
        
        This website will be my first web based artwork that will be part of a public exhibition. Exhibitions are multilayered opportunities to experience, present my work, and connect (network) with other peers/artists/mentors that share interests in this field. I want to make this project because it will:
        <ul>
            <li>Push me to work with specific deadlines</li>
            <li>Push me to practice a proper and orderly process of website building</li>
            <li>Becomes a work in my portfolio</li>
            <li>Becomes experience on my resume</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <p>Some Challenges I will encounter:
            <br>
            <br>
            The website is the red thread of all the content, so I anticipate some difficulty trying to design a cohesive aesthetic that ties everything together, especially if not all the content is made yet.<br>
            <br>
            For most of the techinical things I don't know, I usually figure out by researching online. If I can't find the answer to a specific issue, I will definitely reach out in class or in the coding club discord!
            <br>
            <br>
            Keeping myself accountable for what gets done every week will be the main challenge, especially since researching and watching tutorials can be very time consuming.
