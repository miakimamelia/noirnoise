    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>What kind of website do you want to make for your final project? (Describe the finished project in detail)</li>
        <br>
            The website I want to make is a web based landing page for an interactive Net Art for installation of an internet art cafe.<br>
            I am going to make a poster for it to advertise it.<br>
            I am going to make a logo for it<br>
            I am going to make several pages representing different rooms<br>


        <li>Why do you want to make this project? (for example, you want a portfolio website for applying to things, or…you want to use this project as an opportunity to learn a new skill, or…you want a new work in your portfolio that shows off you skills as a web developer/designer/artist)</li>
        <br>
        I want to make this website because it's going to be my first web based artwork that's going to be exhibited in a group show. It will be an oppurtunity to add to my resume and my portfolio. 


        <li>What challenges (technical, conceptual, design, etc.) do you anticipate encountering in this project? To put that another way, what do you think you’ll struggle with the most with this project?</li>    
</ul>
